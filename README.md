# hangmanWIP
This is a simple Hangman game that need some fixes in order to work
All problems and aditional explanations are written in the code
Suggestions for described problems are welcomed
Features that will be added in the future:
- lives calculated by a formula that depends on the length of the word (i have some code written for it)
- probably a timer for certain words (i don't know how to use async functions)
- a menu with 2 game modes, the classic (that will play the main game loop) and the "endless" (the user will enter a number of games to play and the program will run that many times, the number of lives won't increase only after a threshold. At the end, the player will receive a summary of the play)
- more ascii art for certain actions, even an ascii animation.
